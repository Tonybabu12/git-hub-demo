On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[44] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[57] He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets,[30] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[58]

Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[59] In both 1988 and 1989, Tendulkar was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the Star Cricket Club banner.[60] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[61]

At the start of the 1989–90 season, while playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi.[62]

In the final of 1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab.[63]

In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India.[63] His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[30][64] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[65] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[66][67][68]

In total, Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4.[63]

County cricket
In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players, even UK-based, from outside Yorkshire.[30][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the team and scored 1
